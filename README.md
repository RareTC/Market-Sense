## :pencil: Description

Market Sense is a community based full CRUD Web Application. It pulls up to date data from American Stock Exchanges utilizing an API and renders them on the website
for users to easily digest. Users are able to interact with this data and create their own personal strategies/outlooks that will save in the database. 
Other users are able to view each other's posts regarding companies and better gauge sentiment based off that feedback. In a market as volatile as the one today
having a community to bounce ideas off of and learn from is vital.
